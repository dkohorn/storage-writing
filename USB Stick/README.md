This project is just the msc USB example project provided by Espressif.

This project uses a ESP32-S3 DevkitC-1. In its factory state, this board uses a diode to regulate incoming power. this prevents the USB from getting enough power to operate. To fix this, remove the diode and replace with a direct connection via a jumper wire.
